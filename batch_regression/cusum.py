    """
    Compute the CUSUM test statistic for a batch of time series to assess parameter stability.
    The null hypothesis is that the underlying process is stable over time.
    
    This implementation mimics the classic CUSUM test (based on the Brown-Durbin-Evans approach)
    using the full-sample residuals rather than recursive residuals. It computes the cumulative sum 
    of standardized residuals, and the test statistic is the maximum absolute value of this cumulative 
    sum. Additionally, time-varying boundary functions (based on the asymptotic distribution of a 
    Brownian bridge) are provided for reference.
    
    Args:
        time_series (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [B, T] where B is the number of series
                                    and T is the number of time points.
        regression (str): 'c' for constant or 'ct' for constant plus trend.
        
    Returns:
        cusum_stat (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [B] with the maximum absolute value of the standardized
                                   cumulative sum (CUSUM) for each series.
        cusum_series (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [B, T] containing the standardized cumulative sum series.
        boundaries (tuple of torch.Tensor): A tuple (lower_bound, upper_bound) each of shape [T],
                                   representing the time-varying boundaries at the 5% significance level.
                                   Under the null, the CUSUM series should remain within these bounds.
